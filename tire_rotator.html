            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to design a device that solves a common issue caused by long term storage. When cars sit for long periods of time without being driven, the place on the tire that is in contact with the ground begins to thin and become a "flat spot". These flat spots can cause seriuos damage to the tire and often lead to the tire having to be replaced. Current solutions to this problem involve cradles that spread the weight of the car over a greater surface area. These solutions, however, do not fully solve the problem and are difficult to get into and out of.</p>
            <p>Our solution to this problem involves a modified car dolly that periodically rotates the tires to prevent flat spotting. Since our system is based on a car jack dolly it is quick and easy to deploy and remove and has the added benefit that you can reposition the car in very tight spaces.</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Market Research</h2>
            <p>The first phase of this project was to conduct market research to discover what aspects of our product would be most essential for our product to be succesful. To do this we looked into current solutions and what problems people had with them. We also surveyed over 40 private collectors and storage facilities to see what issues they were facing. The main takaways that we found from this research is that collectors and storage facilities value being able to easily reposition the cars without turning them on and that the current solutions to flat spotting are not sufficient. We then took all this information and produced a Market Requirments Document (MRD) and a Product Requirements Document (PRD). These two documents served as the constraints on our designs. You can view both of these documents below.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Testing and Design</h2>
            <p>One of the most essential features of our product is that the motors have enough torque to rotate the wheels. In order to test how much torque we need we set up and experiment where we place a car in nuetral on flat ground so that it did not roll when the brake was released. We then placed a bathroom against the rear bumper and pushed until the car began to roll. This gave us a measure of the cars internal friciton that our motors would have to overcome.</p>
            <p>Taking the infromation from our test we began designing our system. We decided to modifiy an existing jack system to incorperate our motorized rollers. We went with two planetary gear motors contained within a steel tube roller.</p>

            <h2>Step 3: Techinical Documentation</h2>

            <h2>Step 4: Automation Software</h2>
            <p>Automating the pipetting process required generating precise G-code commands for each well in the 96-well plate. Since each pipetting operation requires 13 unique motor commands, manually writing code for all wells would be impractical and error-prone. To solve this, I developed a Python script that automatically generates all necessary commands and exports them to a G-code file.</p>
            <p>We used Repetier-Host, a 3D printer control software, to execute the G-code and operate the device. The Python script proved invaluable as it allowed us to quickly iterate on motion parameters and optimize the thousands of commands required for complete plate coverage.</p>

            <h2>Step 5: Testing and Optimization</h2>
            <p>During initial testing, we discovered that the original stepper motors lacked sufficient torque to move the pipette vertically as designed. We first attempted to resolve this by adjusting gear ratios to maximize available torque. However, geometric constraints in the system limited the effectiveness of this approach.</p>
            <p>Our solution was to replace the large stepper motor with a smaller toy motor and reduce the vertical movement speed, increasing contact time and effective torque. These modifications successfully achieved the required motion. We then fine-tuned the system by precisely locating each well position and optimizing step sizes for accurate pipetting across the entire plate.</p>

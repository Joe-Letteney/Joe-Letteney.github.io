    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a creative and passionate engineer dedicated to finding efficient solutions to complex problems. I am a fast leaner with an eye for details. I love challenging projects that force me to learn new skills.

My undergraduate degree is in liberal arts with a focus on the history of science and philosophy. While studying I fell in love with applied mathematics and decided to pivot to engineering through Boston Universities' LEAP program.  I am now studying towards my masters degree in mechanical engineering. My unique background and knowledge provide me with a different perspective from most other engineers which allows me to see solutions to problems that others might miss. .</p>

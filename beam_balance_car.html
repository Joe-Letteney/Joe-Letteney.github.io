        <h1>Beam Balance Car Project</h1>
        <h2><stong>Goal</stong></h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a small car that could travel a set distance as fast as possible while balancing a one foot beam on top. This involved several design chanllenges including determining the maximum possible acceleration, writing a PID controler that could smoothly translate the desired velocity profile into motor speeds, and designing a car capable of accomplishing all of this.</p>

        <h2><strong>Calculation</strong></h2>
        <p>The first step in this project was to determine the maximum theoretical acceleration that the car could achieve before the bar tips over. Using moment balance about the edge of the bar we determined it to be 1/12 of the acceleration due to gravity or 32in/s^2. We then tested the motor we were given for the project and determined that its max speed was 235rev/min. Knowing this we determined that in order to achieve our max acceleration we would need wheels approxiametley 5in in diameter. </p>

        <h2><strong>Simulation</strong></h2>
        <p>The next step was to test our calculated values by ujsing Solidwork's Motion Analysis tool. Starting simple, I set up a simple simulation with bar on top of a plate and then applied an increasing acceleration profile and then ploted the reaction forces holding the bar on top and found the point where one of them went to zero indicating that the bar would fall over at that point. As you can see in the figure below this agrees with our theoretical value.</p>

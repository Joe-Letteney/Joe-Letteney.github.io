        <h1>Beam Balance Car Project</h1>
        <p>This project involved designing and manufacturing a small car that can travel a set distance with maximum velocity while balancing a one-foot beam on top. The goal was to explore the mechanics of balancing and how to control motion to achieve stability.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="design">
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>The car was designed with a focus on stability and speed. It includes sensors to detect the angle of the beam and adjusts the speed of the wheels to keep the beam balanced as the car moves forward.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Design Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheelbase designed for balance and stability.</li>
            <li>Motor controller for adjusting wheel speed based on sensor feedback.</li>
            <li>One-foot beam placed on top with a sensor to detect angle shifts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Design Challenges:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensuring precise control of the car's speed to avoid tipping over.</li>
            <li>Integrating sensor feedback into the motor control system.</li>
            <li>Ensuring a compact and lightweight design to avoid excessive weight affecting balance.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="simulation">
        <h2>Simulation</h2>
        <p>Before building the car, simulations were performed using SolidWorks to analyze the behavior of the beam and car system. The simulation helped to fine-tune the design, ensuring that the car could balance the beam while moving at the desired velocity.</p>
        
        <h3>Simulation Results:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The car's motion was simulated using SolidWorks Motion Analysis to visualize how the beam would behave during movement.</li>
            <li>Key parameters such as the beam's tilt angle, center of mass, and velocity were analyzed to determine the optimal design specifications.</li>
        </ul>

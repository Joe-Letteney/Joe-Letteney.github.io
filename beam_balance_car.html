    <section id="overview">
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to create a small car that could travel a set distance as fast as possible while balancing a one-foot beam on top. This involved several design challenges, including determining the maximum possible acceleration, writing a PID controller that could smoothly translate the desired velocity profile into motor speeds, and designing a car capable of accomplishing all of this.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-details">
        <h2>Calculation</h2>
        <p>The first step in this project was to determine the maximum theoretical acceleration that the car could achieve before the bar tips over. Using moment balance about the edge of the bar, we determined it to be 1/12 of the acceleration due to gravity, or 32 in/s². Using this, we calculated our velocity given the maximum possible distance of ten feet. We then tested the motor we were given for the project and determined that its max speed was 235 rev/min. Knowing this, we determined that to achieve our max acceleration, we would need wheels approximately 5 inches in diameter. Finally using our maximum acceleration we determined the ideal velocity profile for ten feet as shown below.</p>

    <section class="project-details">
        <h2>Simulation</h2>
        <p>The next step was to test our calculated values using SolidWorks' Motion Analysis tool. To start, I set up a basic simulation with the bar on top of a plate, applied an increasing acceleration profile, and then plotted the reaction forces holding the bar on top. I found the point where one of them went to zero, indicating that the bar would become unstable at that point. As you can see in the figure below, this agrees with our theoretical value.</p>

        <p>Next, I set up a more detailed simulation to test our theoretical velocity profile. I modeled a simple cart in SolidWorks and then applied the velocity profile, confirming that it did indeed go the intended distance and that the bar remained upright throughout.</p>

        <h2>CAD Design</h2>
        <p>To achieve the features described above, I modeled a small car in OnShape. One of the major difficulties in this project was accounting for any unevenness in the floor, so I opted for the maximum allowed length, which was one foot. We then 3D printed all of the brackets and the wheels and laser cut our base.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-details">
        <h2>Controller Code</h2>
        <p>To achieve the velocity profile that we determined above, our team wrote a PID controller. This allowed us to achieve a smooth velocity profile, which is essential for this problem because dramatic shifts in the elevation profile translate to large accelerations, which would cause the bar to fall over.</p>
        
        <p>You can see the Arduino code used for the PID controller below:</p>

    <section class="project-details">
        <h2>Testing</h2>
        <p>The final step in this project was to put everything together and test it. After running many tests and adjusting the PID values, we were able to get the car to work consistently at a max acceleration of 18 in/s². Despite not being our theoretical maximum, we found that this was the best balance of speed and repeatability, which was crucial for this project.</p>

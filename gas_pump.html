        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to build on our experience of manufacturing a rotary vane pump to design a pump for a specific appliaction that overcame many of the manufacturing challenges that we ran into with the original one. Our team was tasked with designing a gasoline fuel pump for application in a large truck. Our main focus was on designing a pump that met our given specifications that was both cheap and easy to produce and assemble. For this porject we produced a full drawing stack of drawings for our pump including GD&T specifications forn each of our machined parts as well as assembly instructions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Step 1: Material Selection</h2>
            <p>The first step in this project was choosing the materials for our pump. Given Our constraints of high pressure and high yearly production amounts we focused on finding materials that were compatible with gasoline while having high tensile strength and low cost. Using Granta Edupack we ran a number of searches to find suitable materials settling on cast iron gray for the main housing and alloy steel AISI 3031 for the rotor and shaft due to their relatively low coeficient of thermal expansion.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Step 2: Calculations</h2>
            <p>The next step in the process was to do the necessary calculations so that our pump would be able to operate under the given constraints. This included caclualting the PV value of the tip so that we could choose an appropriate material for the vane, FEA analysis on the hosuing to make sure that it can withstand the pressure, calculating the wear rate so that our pump could last for the required lifespan, and clamping force required from our bolts. These calculations informed many of the design choices we made going forward and set the foundation for our pump. To see our full calculation documengt please see the link below.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Step 3: Challenges Overcome</h2>
            <p>One of the major constraints that we discovered during our calculation phase was the extremely high PV value that the tip of the vane would experience. Because of this high value we had to eliminate all plastics as possible vane materials and instead go for a hardened tool steel as our vane material. In order to minimize the outward force on the vane we came up with a unique vane design that allows fluid to flow around the vane while still keeping a sealed surface. This almost entriley balnaces the vanes with respect to the pressure from the fluid and results in the mojority of the force outward being due to centripital force. However, because our vanes were made of steel the wear rate between them and the housing would have been very high so to solve this we designed an insert made of PEEK that would significanlty reduce the wear rate on the vanes and allow the pump to operate for its whole lifetime.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Step 4: Desing For Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>In order to keep our costs low due to our high yearly production quantity we decided to sand cast the main housing. In order to do this we had to make sure that our desin was castable with only one core. We also had to optimize our PEEK insert so that it was possible to injection mold.</p>

        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Step 5: Technical Drawings</h2>
            <p>The final stage of this project was to produce a full stack of technical drawings for our pump including GD&T, full casting drawings for all cast parts, and injection molding drawings for our inserts.</p>

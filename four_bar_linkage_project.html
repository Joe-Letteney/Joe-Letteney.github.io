        <h1>Four Bar Linkage Tutorial</h1>
        <h2><strong>Goal:</strong></h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to become familair with Solidwork's motion analyis feature. This included making sure that the parts are properly constraind so that the system has the correct degrees of freedom and then using the results to analyize the motion of the system.</p>
        

        <h2><strong>Constraints:</strong></h2>
        <p>A key part of this project was assigning the proper constraints to each joint so that the Grubler count reults in the correct degrees of freedom for the system. This process invloves making sure that you have neough constraints to achieve the desired motion but that you also have no redundant constraints.</p>

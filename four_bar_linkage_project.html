        <h1>Four Bar Linkage Tutorial</h1>
        <h2><strong>Goal:</strong></h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to become familair with Solidwork's motion analyis feature. This included making sure that the parts are properly constraind so that the system has the correct degrees of freedom and then using the results to analyize the motion of the system.</p>
        

        <h2><strong>Constraints:</strong></h2>
        <p>A key part of this project was assigning the proper constraints to each joint so that the Grubler count reults in the correct degrees of freedom for the system. This process invloves making sure that you have neough constraints to achieve the desired motion but that you also have no redundant constraints.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Precise motion control for trash can lid opening/closing.</li>
            <li>Minimal wear and tear on moving parts.</li>
            <li>Compact design suitable for most standard trash cans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Simulations and Analysis</h2>
        <p>In SolidWorks, I created detailed simulations to test the performance of the four-bar linkage mechanism. These simulations helped ensure that the system would work effectively and handle the forces applied during normal use.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>Throughout the design process, I encountered several challenges including ensuring the linkage remained compact while providing sufficient motion for the lid. After multiple iterations, I refined the geometry to maximize efficiency and reduce the overall size of the mechanism without compromising performance.</p>

        <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>The final design provided a smooth, reliable operation with a minimalistic approach that could be easily integrated into existing trash can designs. Below is the final rendered image of the system in SolidWorks:</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of mechanical design, kinematics, and simulation. I was able to combine my background in applied mathematics and my engineering skills to create a practical, innovative solution for a common problem.</p>

        <h1>Four Bar Linkage Tutorial</h1>
        <h2><strong>Goal:</strong></h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to become familair with Solidwork's motion analyis feature. This included making sure that the parts are properly constraind so that the system has the correct degrees of freedom and then using the results to analyize the motion of the system.</p>
        

        <h2><strong>Constraints:</strong></h2>
        <p>A key part of this project was assigning the proper constraints to each joint so that the Grubler count reults in the correct degrees of freedom for the system. This process invloves making sure that you have neough constraints to achieve the desired motion but that you also have no redundant constraints.</p>

        <h2><strong>Motion Analysis:</strong></h2>
        <p>Using Solidwork's motion analysis I was able to analyze the system with several different kinds of motion and trace the paths of different points in the system.</p>

        <h2><strong>Assginment Reults:</strong></h2>
        <p>For this assignement I was asked to plot the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The traces of the x and y direction of the midpoint of the Extension and to save them to a csv.<br>
            <a href="Linear Velocity3.csv" download>Download X Direction Trace</a>
            <a href="Linear Velocity4.csv" download>Download Y Direction Trace</a></li>

            <li>The torque of the motor.</li>

        </ol>
        <h2><strong>Results Analysis:</strong></h2>
        <p>The final part of this project was to use the motion analysis tool to determine the following reults:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The maximum value of the motor torque: Looking at the chart above we can see that the maximum value of the torque is approximately 6 pound force per inch.</li>
            <li>The angle of the crank fro which the motor torque is maximum angle: Ploting the torque and the angle of displacement at the same time we can see that the greatest torque occurs when the crank is 180 degrees from its starting position.</li>

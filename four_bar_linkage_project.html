        <h1>Four Bar Linkage Project</h1>
        <p>This project involved designing and simulating a four-bar linkage mechanism for a new trash can design. The linkage was engineered to provide efficient motion for the lid of the trash can while maintaining a compact and functional design.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>The design process included sketching the linkage geometry, choosing appropriate materials, and using SolidWorks to simulate the motion. The goal was to ensure smooth motion, ease of use, and reliability in a variety of conditions. After designing, I conducted motion analysis in SolidWorks to refine the design.</p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Precise motion control for trash can lid opening/closing.</li>
            <li>Minimal wear and tear on moving parts.</li>
            <li>Compact design suitable for most standard trash cans.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Simulations and Analysis</h2>
        <p>In SolidWorks, I created detailed simulations to test the performance of the four-bar linkage mechanism. These simulations helped ensure that the system would work effectively and handle the forces applied during normal use.</p>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>Throughout the design process, I encountered several challenges including ensuring the linkage remained compact while providing sufficient motion for the lid. After multiple iterations, I refined the geometry to maximize efficiency and reduce the overall size of the mechanism without compromising performance.</p>

        <h3>Final Design</h3>
        <p>The final design provided a smooth, reliable operation with a minimalistic approach that could be easily integrated into existing trash can designs. Below is the final rendered image of the system in SolidWorks:</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project helped me develop a deeper understanding of mechanical design, kinematics, and simulation. I was able to combine my background in applied mathematics and my engineering skills to create a practical, innovative solution for a common problem.</p>

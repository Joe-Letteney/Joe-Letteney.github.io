        <h2><strong>Goal</strong></h2>
        <p>The goal of this project was to make a device with three degrees of freedom that would solve some real-world problems. Our group decided to design an automatic pipetter that would be able to dispense liquid quickly and accurately into a 96-well PCR plate. This process is usually done by hand and is long and often tedious. This device is an efficient and inexpensive solution to this problem.</p>

        <h2><strong>Step 1: One linear stage</strong></h2>
        <p>The first step was to create a linear stage capable of moving a small cart in one dimension. To do this, we built the frame out of foam and, using a stepper motor and a lead screw, we built the prototype shown below.</p>

        <h2><strong>Step 2: Three linear stages working together</strong></h2>
        <p>The next step was to work with two other teams to bring three linear stages together to achieve three degrees of freedom. By stacking one linear stage on top of two others and using another stepper motor to control vertical movement, we were able to build a device that could draw shapes on a piece of paper. Each stage was controlled using G-code.</p>

        <h2><strong>Step 3: Design</strong></h2>
        <p>After getting some experience with the stepper motors and G-code from the drawing device, we started designing our automatic pipetter. While my teammate took the lead on designing the linear stages, I focused on designing the mechanism that would hold the pipette itself. For this project, we used a Femto Scientific P10 pipette. I designed a plate that could hold the pipette and allow it to move up and down. I added a rack and pinion mechanism at the top to press the button. I also added a rack to the back of the plate so that another stepper motor could move it vertically. Below are images of my SolidWorks assembly.</p>

        <h2><strong>Step 4: Code</strong></h2>
        <p>To automate this process, we needed to generate all of the G-code commands. Since pipetting into each well requires 13 unique motor commands, rather than writing each command by hand, I wrote a Python script that could generate all of the commands and write them to a G-code file. We then used this file to operate the device using Repetier-Host (a 3D printer software app). The Python script allowed us to easily and quickly make modifications to what ended up being thousands of commands. You can download the Python script below.</p>

        <h2><strong>Step 5: Testing</strong></h2>
        <p>The final step was to put everything together and test it. We quickly realized that the motors we had been given did not have enough torque to move the pipette vertically as designed. To overcome this, we first tried adjusting the gear ratios to maximize available torque. However, due to constraints in the system geometry, this had limited effect. So we replaced our large stepper motor with a much smaller toy motor and reduced the speed of vertical movement to increase contact time. These modifications achieved the desired motion. Once all parts were working, we began dialing in the exact motions by locating the different wells and holes and determining appropriate step sizes.</p>
